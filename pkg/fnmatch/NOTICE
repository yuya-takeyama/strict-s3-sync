NOTICE - Python fnmatch Module Go Port
=======================================

This package contains a Go port of Python's fnmatch module.

Original Python fnmatch module:
Copyright (c) 2001-2024 Python Software Foundation.
All Rights Reserved.
Source: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/fnmatch.py
Licensed under the Python Software Foundation License Version 2

Go port modifications:

Summary of changes from the original Python implementation:
- Ported from Python to Go programming language
- Adapted to use Go's regexp package instead of Python's re module
- Implemented caching using sync.Map instead of Python's lru_cache
- Removed case normalization features (fnmatch vs fnmatchcase distinction)
- All pattern matching is case-sensitive
- Maintained the core pattern matching behavior where * matches path separators

The pattern matching behavior is intentionally kept compatible with Python's
fnmatch module to ensure compatibility with AWS S3 sync exclude patterns.
